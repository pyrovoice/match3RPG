Rules: Match 3 with 5 colors of mana + Pure mana. Can move without matching, 3 moves per turn.
Matching orbs reward the player 1 mana. If colored, a random card of that color in the player's hand also gets 1 mana. 
If pure mana, the player gets a mana + gets a player mana used to activate hero's ability (And cast commander?)

Building a deck allows the player to select X cards and a commander that can be cast as if it was in hand. Can be recast when dead for cost + 2mana/2 player mana?
Creatures go on the field, max 5 at once, can stack to add stats and multiply effects?
Creatures attack on turn end if no summoning sickness. Can be set to block instead of attacking. Can be moved but set in defense if they do so
Add a "Undo" button for non-unknown information actions (can't undo a match, can undo a sphere move)


Ideas:
effect to add more swap, or add a special swap (exchange two orbs, move an entire line instead of a single exchange..)
Traps and constants that stay in play. Traps trigger on match, constant have a life that is reduced when matching or by card effect
No draw per turn but a draw action costing more every time?
